It declares the principle \"write once, run anywhere\" (WORA) meaning a Java application can be executed on any platform where a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is installed. Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years. According to the TIOBE index , it is in the first position. The applicability of the language allows developers to write large client-server web applications, modern desktop and mobile applications, useful frameworks, and libraries. Short history The Java language project was initiated in 1991 by James Gosling and others. In the beginning, the language was called \"Oak\". Sun Microsystems released the Java 1.0 in 1995. In 2014 Java 8 was released. This version introduced partial support for functional programming and some other updates. To date, the latest version is Java 9. The first stable release of Java 9 was on September 21, 2017. Some important features of Java Let's consider several important features of Java. Platform independence: The compiler converts the source code to bytecode, and, then, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes the bytecode. Each operating system has a different JVM, but every JVM can execute the bytecode, therefore, it works on Windows, Linux, Mac OS and other platforms. So, a program that is written and compiled on one platform can run on another platform. It makes the Java platform completely independent. Simple and clear syntax: Java has syntax like C/C++ and C#. Many syntax elements of the language are readable and widely used in programming. Multi-paradigm: Java is primarily an object-oriented and imperative programming language where almost everything is an object of a class (type). We can consider a typical Java program as a set of interacting objects. The objects can represent entities from the real world or some kind of programming abstractions. When we write a program, we explain how the objects should interact with each others. Actually, Java also supports multiple modern programming paradigms including generic programming, concurrent programming, functional programming (partially supported) and others. Garbage collector: It performs automatic memory cleaning of unused objects at runtime. Built-in multithreading: Java supports multithreading at the language and the standard library levels. It allows concurrent and parallel execution of several parts of a Java program. For more features see here Programming and running processes You will write source code in plain-text files with a .java extension. The files will be compiled into .class files (bytecode) by the javac compiler. To run an application you will use the java tool. The tool can start a .class file with the main method and even whole JAR with multiple classes. Also, it's possible to write bytecode directly but this is not considered in the topic. The following picture shows the very simplified process of writing and running programs using Java: A Java developer writes a program in a text file with the .java extension. The program may include a lot of such files. Then the compiler (usually, javac) translates the program into a .class file containing the bytecode of the program. After, the JVM executes the program giving low-level commands to the computer. Here, the computer is an abstraction that may be a server, PC or even a mobile device. It includes an operating system and a hardware. Actually, the processes are more complex than the image shows. It is important to note the following: the part before JVM is platform independent, the part after the JVM is platform dependent.","title":"Intro"},{"location":"1.1.introduction/#introduction","text":"Java is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation).

The first kind is performed automatically by the Java compiler, the second type - only by a programmer. Implicit casting The compiler automatically performs casting when the target type is wider than source type: There is no loss of information because the target type is wider than the source type. Examples: int intVal = 8; long longVal = intVal + 1; // implicit casting from int to long double doubleVal = longVal; // implicit casting from long to double Explicit casting The explicit casting is performed by a programmer when the target type is narrower than the source type. This kind of casting may lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value and may also lose precision. Sometimes this can be the desired behavior. Any type casting not presented in the picture above requires explicit casting, for example: double -> int, long -> char. Examples: double d = 2.00003; long l = (long) d; // it loses the fractional part int i = (int) l; // explicit type casting required int val = (int) (1 + 2L + 3); // requires explicit casting because the result is long When performing explicit casting, type overflow is possible.

Remember, it's not a primitive type. It is one of the most widely used types in Java. Here is an example of a string: \"Hello, Java\". This string is a sequence of 11 characters, including one space. This type has some features: * immutable type: it's impossible to change a character in a string; * it has methods for getting individual characters and substrings; * characters can be accessed by indexes, the first character has the index 0, the last one - the length of the string - 1. Creating strings A string literal is surrounded by a pair of double quotes, for instance: String simpleString = \"It is a simple string\"; // a simple string System.out.println(simpleString); // it prints \"It is a simple string\" String anotherString = \"This is\\nanother\\nstring\"; // a string with escape sequences System.out.println(anotherString); // it prints the result is several lines A string can represent a long character sequence (text). A string can have one or zero characters. String strangeText = \"aaaaaaaaaaaassssssssssss gggggggggggggggggggg ddddddddddd qqqqqq ffff\"; String emptyString = \"\"; String s = \"s\"; // a string consisting of one character A string can be null. It means no any value assigned. String nullString = null; // it is null Another way to create a variable of type String is used the keyword new. String str = new String(\"my-string\"); // it creates an object and assigns it to the variable Get the length and characters of a string Any string has two useful methods: * length() returns the number of characters in the string; * charAt(index) returns a character by its index; Here is an example: String s = \"Hi, all\"; int len = s.length(); // the len is 7 char theFirstChar = s.charAt(0); // 'H' has the index 0 char theFifthChar = s.charAt(4); // 'a' has the index 4 char theLastChar = s.charAt(s.length() - 1); // 'l' has the index 6 Note, you can easily get a character of a string by the index, but you can't change characters because strings are immutable in Java. Useful methods of strings The standard library of Java provides a lot of useful methods for processing strings: * isEmpty() returns true if the string is empty, otherwise - false; * toUpperCase() returns a new string in uppercase; * toLowerCase() returns a new string in lowercase; * startsWith(prefix) returns true if the string is start with the given string prefix, otherwise - false; * contains(...) returns true if the string contains the given string or character; * substring(beginIndex, endIndex) returns a substring of the string in the range: beginIndex, endIndex - 1; * replace(old, new) returns a new string obtained by replacing all occurrences of old with new that can be chars or strings. See the following example to better understand these methods: String text = \"The simple text string\"; boolean empty = text.isEmpty(); // false String textInUpperCase = text.toUpperCase(); // \"THE SIMPLE TEXT STRING\" boolean startsWith = simple.startsWith(\"THE\"); // true /* replace all whitespaces with empty strings */ String noWhitespaces = text.replace(\" \", \"\"); // \"THESIMPLETEXTSTRING\" Listed methods can take different arguments. See Java API for details: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html Exceptions when processing strings When working with strings, there can be several exceptions. NullPointerException. If a string is null and you call a method of the string, it throws NullPointerException. String s = null; int length = s.length(); // it throws NullPointerException ```` 2. StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. If you try to access a non-existing character by an index then this exception occurs. ```java String s = \"ab\"; char c = s.charAt(2); // it throws StringIndexOutOfBoundsException Be careful. Concatenating strings Two string can be concatenated using the \"+\" operator or the concat method. In both cases, the result is the same. String firstName = \"John\"; String lastName = \"Smith\"; // concatenation using the \"+\" operator String fullName1 = firstName + \" \" + lastName; // \"John Smith\" // concatenation using the concat method String fullName2 = firstName.concat(\" \").concat(lastName); // \"John Smith\" When we concatenate two strings a new string is created (because strings are immutable). Important: in the general case str1 + str2 is not the same as str2 + str1 because the concatenation is not a commutative operation. Appending values to a string It's possible to add values of different types to a string. The value will be automatically converted to a string. See an example below. String str = \"str\" + 10 + false; // the result is \"str10false\" ```` In the example above, the order of execution is: ```java \"str\" + 10 => \"str10\" \"str10\" + false = \"str10false\" Let's see more complex example: String shortString = \"str\"; long number = 100; String result1 = shortString + number + 50; // the result is \"str10050\" String result2 = number + 50 + shortString; // what is the result2? The result2 is 150str, because, first, we calculate a sum of number and 50 and then concat it with str. The order of operations is important. How to compare strings correctly? The strings are a reference type you shouldn't compare them using \"==\" or \"!=\" operators. In these case, only addresses will be compared, but not actual values. A string has two convenient methods for comparing it with other strings: equals(other) and equalsIgnoreCase(other). See an example below. String first = \"first\"; String second = \"second\"; String anotherFirst = \"first\"; String secondInUpperCase = \"SECOND\"; System.out.println(first.equals(second)); // false, the strings have different values System.out.println(first.equals(anotherFirst)); // true, the strings have the same value System.out.println(second.equals(secondInUpperCase)); // false, the strings have different cases System.out.println(second.equalsIgnoreCase(secondInUpperCase)); // true, it ignores cases Do not forget the rules when comparing strings. Regular Expressions Here is a simple java regex example that uses a regular expression to check if a text contains the substring http:// : String text = \"This is the text to be searched \" + \"for occurrences of the http:// pattern.\"; String regex = \".*http://.*\"; boolean matches = Pattern.matches(regex, text); System.out.println(\"matches = \" + matches); The text variable contains the text to be checked with the regular expression. The pattern variable contains the regular expression as a String. The regular expression matches all texts which contains one or more characters (. ) followed by the text http:// followed by one or more characters (. ). The third line uses the Pattern.matches() static method to check if the regular expression (pattern) matches the text. If the regular expression matches the text, then Pattern.matches() returns true. If the regular expression does not match the text Pattern.matches() returns false. The example does not actually check if the found http:// string is part of a valid URL, with domain name and suffix (.com, .net etc.). The regular expression just checks for an occurrence of the string http://.

It means a Java program can be considered to be a collection of objects that communicate via calling each other's methods. A typical Java program includes a lot of classes, interfaces, objects, and other concepts from object-oriented programming. Even the simplest \"procedural-style\" program should have at least one class and the main method inside it to start the program. The main method is the entry point for any applications. Ever since Java 7 there has been no other way to start an application without this method (excluding the case when you start your application inside a special container for applications but it is not considered in this course). Let's see an example of the simplest application that prints the text \"Hello, Java\" in the standard output: class Task { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"Hello, Java\"); } } Here is a class named Task. The class contains the main method for starting the program. It is important to mention that a class containing the main method can have any name, but the main method should always have the same name. Let's take a closer look at the declaration of the main method: public static void main(String[] args) The keyword public indicates that the method can be invoked from everywhere The keyword static indicates the method can be invoked without creating an instance of the class The keyword void indicates the method doesn't return any value The array variable args contains arguments entered at the command line if there are no arguments then the array is empty As you can see, even the simplest Java application contains a lot of concepts. All of them will be studied in the next few topics which relate to methods and object-oriented programming. For now you just need to understand how to write and run a simple Java program with the main method. Invalid declarations of the main method If the main method has an invalid declaration, two cases are possible: your program cannot be compiled your program is successfully compiled but can't be started Your program cannot be compiled It is the case when the main method declaration breaks the syntax of Java. Example: no returning value (even void) class Task { public static main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"Hello, Java\"); } } Example: a mistake in the keyword (pubic instead of public) class Task { pubic static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"Hello, Java\"); } } A program can be compiled but cannot be run It is the case when the main method has a correct declaration as a regular method but it doesn't satisfy the specific requirement of the main method. Examples: should be String[] args class Task { public static main(String args) { System.out.println(\"Hello, Java\"); } } Example: there is no keyword static class Task { public void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"Hello, Java\"); } } In both cases, an error happens at runtime. Conclusion So, the main method is the entry point of any Java programs. It has a very specific syntax which you need to remember.

It has a name (identifier) and a type. The name identifies a variable in some context. It's possible to read and change the value of a variable by its name. The general form for declaring variables is the following: DataType variableName; The type (data type) of a variable determines which values can be stored in the variable and the possible operations you can perform on them. Data types Java is a statically typed programming language, which means that every variable and every expression has a type that is known at the compile time. All data types are separated into two groups: primitive types and references types. A primitive type variable stores a simple value (such as a number or character). Java has eight primitive data types. They can be divided into four groups: integer numbers: byte, short, int, long (for example, 83 is an integer number) floating-point numbers: float, double (for example, 3.1415 is a floating point number) logical type: boolean (true or false) characters: char (for example, 'a', '3') The most used primitive types are int, long, boolean, char and double. primitiveDataTypes A reference type variable stores an address in memory where the data is located. The data can be made up as a complex structure that includes other data types as their parts. We will often use the reference type String. It represents a sequence of characters like \"abc\" or \"Hello, Java\". Let's declare a variable named number of the type int: int number; Here is a variable named text of the type String: String text; Sizes and ranges of primitive types Integer types store numbers such as 10, 15, -14. The size of the values that can be stored depends on the integer type that we choose. The range of values is calculated as \u2212(2n\u22121) -2^(n-1) to 2^(n\u22121)\u22121, where n is the number of bits. The range includes 0 as well. byte: the size is 8 bits (1 byte), the range is from -128 to +127 short: the size is 16 bits (2 bytes), the range is from -32768 to +32767 int: the size is 32 bits (4 bytes), the range is from \u2212(2^31) to +(2^31)-1 long: the size is 64 bits (8 bytes), the range is from \u2212(2^63) to +(2^63)-1 Floating-point types represent numbers with a fractional part. float: the size is 32 bits (4 bytes), the range is from 3.4e\u2212038 to 3.4e+038 (approximately, 6-7 significant decimal digits) double: the size is 64 bits (8 bytes), the range is from 1.7e\u2212308 to 1.7e+308 (approximately, 14-16 significant decimal digits) The character type (char) stores the character constant in the memory. The size is 16 bits (2 bytes). The range is from 0 to 65536 (unsigned). The boolean type can store only two values: true or false. It represents only one bit of information, but its size is not something that's precisely defined. So, remember Java has 8 primitive types. The most used are int, long, boolean, char, and double. The assignment operator Java has a special operator denoted as =. It assigns a value to a variable. In this case, the variable has to be declared already: variableName = value; It is also possible to declare and initialize a variable in one line: DataType variableName = value; class Task { public static void main(String[] args) { // put your code here int one = 1; // declares an integer variable \"one\" and assigns the value 1 to it int two; // declares an integer variable \"two\" two = 2; // assign the value 2 to the variable \"two\" int three = 3, four = 4; // declares two integer variables and assigns values to them } } To read the value of a variable you should write its name. For example, let's print the variables: System.out.println(one); // prints 1 System.out.println(two); // prints 2 System.out.println(three); // prints 3 System.out.println(four); // prints 4 In the following example, the variable five is declared and initialized with the value of another variable: int five = four; // read the value of the variable \"four\" and assign it to the variable \"five\"; Here are some more variables: char ch = 'A'; // declare a character variable named \"ch\" and assign 'A' to it String str = \"Hello, Java\"; // declare a string variable named \"str\" and assign text to it double pi = 3.1415; // declare a double variable named \"pi\" and assign 3.1415 to it For more details about variables go here : https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/variables.html Rules for naming variables Java has some rules for naming variables: names are case-sensitive a name can include Unicode letters, digits, and two special characters ($, _) a name can't start with a digit a name must not be a keyword (class, static, and int are illegal names) You cannot break these rules, otherwise, your program will not compile. Here are some legal names of variables: number, $ident, bigValue, _val, abc, k, var And here are some illegal ones: @ab, 1c, !ab, class Ever since Java 9, the single character _ is an illegal way to name a variable, but _a and __ are legal names. Naming conventions for variables Also, there are naming conventions for naming variables: if a variable name has a single word it should be in lowercase (for instance: number, val) if a variable name includes multiple words it should be in lowerCamelCase, i.e. the first word should be in lowercase and each word after the first has its first letter written in uppercase (for instance: numberOfCoins) variable names should not start with _ or $ characters, even though both are allowed These conventions are not required, but it is strongly recommended to follow them. They make your code more readable for yourself and other Java programmers. Input and output in Java code There are several ways to read values from the standard input. The first way is to use java.util.Scanner. Let's read two integer numbers from the standard input, add them together and write the result in the standard output: import java.util.Scanner; public class Task { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); int a = scanner.nextInt(); // it reads an integer value from the standard input int b = scanner.nextInt(); // it reads another integer value from the standard input System.out.println(a + b); // it writes the result of a + b in the standard output } } Another common way to read integer numbers is to use java.io.BufferedReader. Let's read two integer numbers, add them together and write the result in the standard output again: import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.InputStreamReader; import java.io.IOException; public class Task { public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { // the object for reading BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); // it takes a string and splits it by whitespaces String[] values = reader.readLine().split(\"\\\\s+\"); int a = Integer.parseInt(values[0]); // It converts the first value to integer int b = Integer.parseInt(values[1]); // It converts the second value to integer System.out.println(a + b); } } IDE tips & tricks Code autocompletion can help you to find the right variable.

The largest one is long and smallest one is byte. Let's declare and initialize several variables of different integer types: class Task { public static void main(String[] args) { int decimalNumber = 500; // a decimal number, it consists of digits 0-9 int hexNumber = 0xFF; // a hexadecimal number, it consists of digits 0-9 and letters A-F int binaryNumber = 0b10001; // a binary number, it consists of digits 0 and 1 int octalNumber = 0335; // an octal number, it consists of digits 0-7 long longNumber = 33L; // L or l - is a literal for longs long bigNumber = 100_000_000_000L; // _ is the underscore character } } If an integer value ends with the letter L or l it is the type long, otherwise it is the type int. It's recommended to use the uppercase letter L because the lowercase letter l is similar to the digit 1. The default value for all integer types is 0 (zero): int intZero; // it's equal to 0; long longZero; // it's equal to 0L; ```` To know the max and min values for these types you should write the following code: ```java int minInt = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // The min value of int type int maxInt = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // The max value of int type long minLong = Long.MIN_VALUE; // The min value of long type long maxLong = Long.MAX_VALUE; // The max value of long type Now it's time to learn about arithmetic operations for integer types. Binary operators The Java programming language provides operators for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (integer) and remainder with two integer numbers (byte, short, int, long). The first three operators should be absolutely clear, but the last two may need additional explanation. The operator / returns the integer part of division two numbers, a fractional part is discarded. The operator % returns the remainder of two numbers. For instance 10 % 3 is 1 because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. See the following example: int a = 6; int b = 2; int sum = a + b; // addition, the result is 8 int diff = a - b; // subtraction, the result is 4 int mult = a * b; // multiplication, the result is 12 int intDiv = a / b; // integer division, the result is 3 int remainder = a % b; // remainder, the result is 0 All five operators can be performed for negative numbers as well. Let's consider another example with integer division and remainder: int a = 15; Int b = 6; // a is 15, b is 6 int intDiv = a / b; // integer division, the result is 2 int rem = a % b; // remainder, the result is 3 int negRem = -21 % 4; // the result is -1 because -21 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of -1 Be careful with the dividing numbers by zero (0). It throws a runtime exception. int divResult = 5 / 0; // throws ArithmeticException int remResult = 5 % 0; // also throws ArithmeticException Unary operators Also there are several unary operators: unary plus, unary minus, increment (prefix and postfix), decrement (prefix and postfix). The unary plus indicates a positive value. It's an optional operator. The unary minus negates a value or an expression: int a = +4; // unary plus indicates the positive value (it's an optional operator) int b = -a; // unary minus negates the value 4, the result is -4 b = -b; // negate the value again, the result is 4 The increment operator adds 1 to the variable's value. The decrement operator subtracts 1 from the variable's value. Both operators exist in two forms: prefix and postfix. The difference between prefix and postfix forms is the order of execution. In the prefix form first of all the value is changed and then it is assigned to another variable. In the postfix form at first the value is assigned to another variable and then it is changed: int a = 5; // a is 5 int b = ++a; // prefix increment: b is 6, a is 6 int c = b++; // postfix increment: c is 6, b is 7 int d = c--; // postfix decrement: d is 6, c is 5 ```` ##The different forms of the assignment operator In Java the assignment operator (\"=\") has several additional forms: +=, *=, /=, %= and so one: ```java int a = 2, b = 3, c = 4; a += b; // the same as a = a + b, the result is 5 c *= b; // the same as c = c * b, the result is 12 Arithmetic and assignment operators precedence Operators have different priorities in expressions. These priorities define the operator's precedence (the order of execution). Below, the studied operators are listed according to precedence order (from the highest to the lowest): unary: +, -, ++, -- multiplicative: *, /, % additive: +, - assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /= To change the order of execution, you can enclose the expression in parentheses like in mathematics: ```java int a = 3 + 4 * 5; // the result is 23 int b = (3 + 4) * 5; // the result is 35 int c = 1 + (2 * (3 + (4 * (5 + 6)))); // 11 -> 44 -> 47 -> 94 -> 95 ```` Note: All listed rules are also valid for other integer types: byte, short, long.","title":"Integer"},{"location":"1.5.integer/#integer","text":"An overview of primitive types for integer numbers There are four ways to represent integer numbers in Java: byte, short, int, and long.

See the following example: int a = 6; int b = 2; int sum = a + b; // addition, the result is 8 int diff = a - b; // subtraction, the result is 4 int mult = a * b; // multiplication, the result is 12 int intDiv = a / b; // integer division, the result is 3 int remainder = a % b; // remainder, the result is 0 All five operators can be performed for negative numbers as well. Let's consider another example with integer division and remainder: int a = 15; Int b = 6; // a is 15, b is 6 int intDiv = a / b; // integer division, the result is 2 int rem = a % b; // remainder, the result is 3 int negRem = -21 % 4; // the result is -1 because -21 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of -1 Be careful with the dividing numbers by zero (0).

The unary plus indicates a positive value. It's an optional operator. The unary minus negates a value or an expression: int a = +4; // unary plus indicates the positive value (it's an optional operator) int b = -a; // unary minus negates the value 4, the result is -4 b = -b; // negate the value again, the result is 4 The increment operator adds 1 to the variable's value. The decrement operator subtracts 1 from the variable's value. Both operators exist in two forms: prefix and postfix. The difference between prefix and postfix forms is the order of execution. In the prefix form first of all the value is changed and then it is assigned to another variable. In the postfix form at first the value is assigned to another variable and then it is changed: int a = 5; // a is 5 int b = ++a; // prefix increment: b is 6, a is 6 int c = b++; // postfix increment: c is 6, b is 7 int d = c--; // postfix decrement: d is 6, c is 5 ```` ##The different forms of the assignment operator In Java the assignment operator (\"=\") has several additional forms: +=, *=, /=, %= and so one: ```java int a = 2, b = 3, c = 4; a += b; // the same as a = a + b, the result is 5 c *= b; // the same as c = c * b, the result is 12","title":"Unary operators"},{"location":"1.5.integer/#arithmetic-and-assignment-operators-precedence","text":"Operators have different priorities in expressions.

The default value for this type is false. boolean t = true; // t is true boolean f = false; // f is false boolean defaultValue; // defaultValue is false Note: Remember, you cannot assign an integer value to a boolean variable. In Java, 0 is not equal to false. Logical operators There are four logical operators NOT, AND, OR and XOR which allow us to build logical expressions. The NOT operator is a unary operator that reverses the boolean value. It is written as !. boolean f = false; // f is false boolean t = !f; // t is true The AND operator is a binary operator that returns true if both operands are true, otherwise, it is false. The operator can be written as && and &. boolean b1 = false && false; // false boolean b2 = false && true; // false boolean b3 = true && false; // false boolean b4 = true && true; // true The OR operator is a binary operator that returns true if at least one operand is true, otherwise, it returns false. The operator can be written as ||and |. boolean b1 = false || false; // false boolean b2 = false || true; // true boolean b3 = true || false; // true boolean b4 = true || true; // true The XOR (exclusive OR) operator is a binary operator that returns true if boolean operands have different values, otherwise, it is false. The operator is written as ^ and can be used Instead of the relation operator != (NOT EQUAL TO). boolean b1 = false ^ false; // false boolean b2 = false ^ true; // true boolean b3 = true ^ false; // true boolean b4 = true ^ true; // false Short-circuit operators The AND and OR operators have two forms: AND ( &, &&), OR ( |, ||). There are some differences: * the & and | operators are also used as bitwise operators for integer types; * the && and || operator perform Conditional-AND and Conditional-OR operations on two boolean expressions. These operators are called \"short-circuit\" operators, which means that the second operand is evaluated only when it is needed (when the first argument doesn't suffice to determine the value of the expression). In the following example, the second operand a>5 will not be evaluated because the result is determined by the first operand (a==10 is false): int a = 20; boolean result = (a == 10) && (a > 5); // the second expressions can't be evaluated The precedence of logical operators Below the logical operations are sorted in order of their priority in expressions: ! - NOT & - AND ^ - XOR | - OR && - conditional AND || - conditional OR So, the following statement is true: boolean b = true && !false; // true, because !false is evaluated first Relational operators A relational operator tests or defines some kind of relation between two operands. Java has six relational operators: == (equal to) != (not equal to) (greater than) = (greater than or equal to) < (less than) <= (less than or equal to) The result of applying a relational operator to operands is the boolean type (true or false). Operators == and != can be applied to operands of any primitive types, but operators >, >=, <, <= cannot be applied to boolean operands. In expressions, the relational operators have a lower priority than arithmetic operators. Comparing integer numbers Relational operators allow you to easily compare two integer numbers: int num1 = 4; int num2 = 2; boolean b1 = num1 == num2; // false boolean b2 = num1 > num2; // true boolean b3 = 500 != 500; // false boolean b4 = 300 <= 300; // true We can compare longs, bytes, and shorts in the same way. In the following example, first, the sums will be calculated and then will be compared using the operator >: long number = 1000; boolean result = number + 10 > number + 9; // 1010 > 1009 is true Comparing characters Characters are ordered, it's possible to compare two characters by their code values using any relational operations. Characters can be compared ( ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=) by their codes: System.out.println('a' < 'b'); // prints \"true\" System.out.println('a' == 'a'); // prints \"true\" System.out.println('e' < 'E'); // prints \"false\" Comparing floating-point numbers During the operation with floating-point numbers, errors can be accumulated. Do not use == or != when comparing floating-point numbers in Java. Instead, if you'd like to compare two floating-point values a and b, use the standard way: Math.abs(a - b) < eps It means the absolute value of the difference is less than a certain epsilon. Here is an example why it's important: double val = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1; // 0.99999... System.out.println(val == 1.0); // it prints \"false\" System.out.println(Math.abs(val - 1.0) < 1e-6); // it prints \"true\" Joining relational operations using logical operators In Java, you cannot write an expression like this: a <= b <= c Instead, you should join two boolean expressions using logical operators like || and &&. For example, we'd like to check the expression: 100 < number < 200 In Java we should write something like this: number > 100 && number < 200 Also, we can write with parentheses: (number > 100) && (number < 200) But parentheses are not necessary here because relational operators have the higher priority than logical operators. Here is a more general example of variables: ```java //the code checks that the value of number belongs to a range int number = ... // it has a value int low = 100, high = 200; // borders boolean inRange = number > low && number < high; // join two expressions using AND \u222b``` So, logical operators allow you to join a sequence of relational operations into one expression.","title":"Boolean"},{"location":"1.6.boolean/#the-boolean-type","text":"The boolean is a primitive data type that has only two possible values: false or true.

A conditional statement is a construct that allows a program to perform different computations depending on a boolean condition. If the condition is true, the program performs one computation; otherwise, the condition is false and the program performs another computation. The condition can be any boolean expression, for instance: a > b, i - j == 1 and so on. There are three types of conditional statements. We will give examples of all of them. A single if statement The simplest form of the conditional statement is the following: if (condition) { // do something } In this case, if the condition is true, the action inside the code block is executed. Otherwise, the program skips the action. See the following example. int age = ...; // it has a value if (age < 3) { System.out.println(\"This person is too young\"); } In this example, if the age is less than 3, the program prints \"This person is too young\". Otherwise, it does nothing. If-else statement The if statement can also be extended to do something else if the condition is false. if (condition) { // do something } else { // do something else } ![ifelse](img/if-else.jpg) In the above code, if the condition is \"true\", the first code block is executed. Otherwise, the second code block is executed. In the example below, the program outputs different text depending on the value of num (even or odd). Note that a whole number is even if it can be divided evenly by 2; otherwise, it's odd. ```java int num = ...; // num is assigned some value if (num % 2 == 0) { System.out.println(\"It's an even number\"); } else { System.out.println(\"It's an odd number\"); } For example, if the value of num is 10, the program outputs \"It's an even number\". If the value is 11, it outputs \"It's an odd number\". If-else-if statements The most general form of the if-else statement consists of multiple conditions and else-branches. if (condition0) { // do something } else if (condition1) { // do something else 1 // ... } else if (conditionN) { // do something else N } The following code outputs recommendations as to what type of computer you should buy depending on your budget. long dollars = ...; // your budget if (dollars < 1000) { System.out.println(\"Buy a laptop\"); } else if (dollars < 2000) { System.out.println(\"Buy a personal computer\"); } else if (dollars < 100000) { System.out.println(\"Buy a server\"); } else { System.out.println(\"Buy a data center or a quantum computer\"); } This conditional statement has four branches: dollars < 1000, dollars < 2000, dollars < 100000 and dollars >= 100000. For eample, if the value of dollars is 9000, it prints \"Buy a server\".","title":"Conditionals"},{"location":"3.1.conditionals/#conditionals","text":"","title":"Conditionals"},{"location":"3.1.conditionals/#what-is-a-conditional-statement","text":"A conditional statement is a construct that allows a program to perform different computations depending on a boolean condition.
